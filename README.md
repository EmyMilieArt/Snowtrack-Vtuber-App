# SnowDot
An Open source vtuber app made in Godot

# What is this project?
This is an open-source vtuber app made by vtubers, for vtubers.
It's meant to be a base for intermediate and advanced users for now, but will expand to be as user-friendly as possible in the future.

# What's planned?
I want to add a lot more features over time. For now, here's what I have in mind:
- load avatars straight from blender with an integrated setup
- load decor and props straight from file, and edit them directly without conversion to another format
- more tracking options like webcam, kinect and mediapipe
- the possibility to run the app on another computer to avoid slurping graphical power from your streaming pc
- Live2D support
- PNGtuber support

And probably more. Want a feature? Let us know, or code it yourself!

# Known issues
At the moment, this is what I know is broken. This is very early in the projects - bugs and unpolished features are to be expected.
Here goes:
- The only tracking supported as of now is ARKit. IfacialMocap (Iphone) and Meowface (Android) both work and are supported.
- There is no way to easily import an avatar - you have to do the setup yourself. I will have resources up for that in the future.
- Only 3D avatars are supported at the moment.
- The code is not always super optimized - I'm doing my best.

# Credit where credit is due
